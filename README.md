## Overview
### Description
Split checks via reading receipts through photo recognition.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Finance
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** Users can take pictures of their receipts and split bill amounts to different people.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they go out to eat with others.
- **Scope:** First users can scan receipt and split checks, then perhaps this could evolve so that users can keep a log or history of their spending records. Large potential for use with other payment services like Venmo, Paypal, and ApplePay.
